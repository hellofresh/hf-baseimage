hf-baseimage
===============

Based on the very well designed [phusion/baseimage-docker](https://github.com/phusion/baseimage-docker).

Each time building this image, an [Ubuntu distribution upgrade](https://github.com/phusion/baseimage-docker#upgrading-the-operating-system-inside-the-container) is performed to apply the latest security patches.



#### TODO

- [ ] Add `ONBUILD` trigger instructions for more specialised HF images
- [ ] Add base tests.
- [ ] ...
